                        When you think of Africa, you'd probably know it as a continent of the wild. Just 
                        like South America, many of its countries aren't really known for being 
                        industrialized. But upon checking out some of its wonders, I've come to find out 
                        that that's not necessarily a bad thing for this only means that its natural 
                        wonders are as preserved and beautiful as it can be. Here are some of those 
                        wonders!

                        The Tsitsikamma National Park in <em>South Africa</em> is known for its iconic 
                        Suspension Footbridges. The footbridges can be found along the Garden Route and spans 
                        the mouth of the Storms River. It consist of 3 individual footbridges, with the 
                        longest one measuring at 77 meters long. No need for worry, for even though these 
                        are suspension bridges that sway, it is very much stable and secure.

                        Namibia</em> is the place where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic Ocean. Like 
                        the Huacahina Sand Dunes of Peru, the Sandwich Harbour also features a landscape
                        of towering sand dunes plunging directly into the ocean. The lagoon here is 
                        surrounded by sand and reeds, and is a hotspot for wildlife. Often a place where 
                        birds and seals can be seen.

                        "How does that even work?", you may ask, and I shall answer. It is not actually 
                        an underwater waterfall, but rather, an optical illusion craeted by the sands 
                        and silt sediments moving along the ocean floor. The Underwater Waterfall near 
                        the Le Morne Peninsula, off the southwestern coast of <em>Mauritius</em>, sits on
                        an ocean shelf that abruptly drops off into a deep abyss and the sand and silt 
                        from the coastal shelf are swept along by the ocean currents.

                        As you can see from some of the photos, the seemingly best way to appreciate and 
                        view this natural wonder is through a helicopter ride.
