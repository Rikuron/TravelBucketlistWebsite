                        Most people probably wouldn't expect someone to have Antarctica as a part of their 
                        travel bucketlist, but hey, guess I'm different. I love the cold, and technically 
                        speaking, the lowest ever temperature recorded in the world occurred here in 
                        Antarctica. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There aren't a lot of people here (which, in my introverted opinion, is something 
                        I very much would like, yes), the only people who reside here are scientific 
                        researchers. This is actually part of the reason of why I wrote Bachelor of Science 
                        in Marine Biology as my third option in my college application. I'd love to do 
                        research here, especially since Antarctica is rich with marine wildlife, and I've 
                        always loved the sea.

                There is a serious problem however, with the rapid advancement of technology and the 
                advent of modernization, humanity releases its effects out into the planet's atmosphere. 
                And we've all heard of global warming right? It's very much real and it's what's causing 
                the intense climate change, an effect that Antarctica feels very greatly. The continent of 
                ice and cold now feels the heat of our greed, and due to it, the ice of Antarctica melts. 
            </p>

        <div class="continent_introduction">
            <p> 
                We must remember that our actions have consequences, even the littlest ones can pile on 
                top of another until it all culminates to one big, uncontrollable, global catastrophe.
                Let's not get to that point. Exercise caution and cleanliness, that candy wrapper that 
                you have, yes, you can just put it in your pocket until you find a suitable trash can or
                bin to dispose it in, it's not hard, let's not be lazy.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The trees are an integral part of our environment and is one of the factors that can 
                affect our atmosphere. Protect them, and if you can, plant more of them. Just as said in 
                the Hamilton Musical, "What is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you'll never get
                to see." The effects may not be immediate and there's a possibility that it may take 
                decades or centuries to have noticeable effects, but there will be. That will be your 
                legacy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Help protect our environment, so that someday, not only will I be able to enjoy the 
                wonders of this world, you will too!
