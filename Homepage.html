                                        Have you ever watched anime? There always seem to be a scene in 
                                        which the main character is in a scene of self-reflection of sorts, 
                                        and somehow, the scene's background is almost always a seemingly 
                                        infinite expanse of water, with nothing else in the visible 
                                        vicinity. The water below their feet is shallow, enough so that no 
                                        water gets inside their shoes. And the water is so clear that it 
                                        reflects the sky and clouds above so clearly. Well that place 
                                        exists not only in anime, it's in the real world too!

                                        Welcome to Salar de Uyuni! The world's largest salt flat. It can 
                                        be found in <strong>Daniel Campos Province, Potosi Department, 
                                        Southwest Bolivia</strong>. It used to be the location of several 
                                        prehistoric lakes but its water had all evaporated now. What's left 
                                        is an extremely flat layer of salt crust. Oftentimes, the area 
                                        looks very barren save for the hexagonal formations you will see 
                                        on its surface, but here's where things change. After rain, a thin 
                                        layer of water would cover the surface, and watch, as it becomes 
                                        the world's largest natural mirror!

                                        We've all heard of the Northern Lights. The Aurora Borealis, while 
                                        it is not exactly a place, it is more of a phenomenon that happens 
                                        when solar particles that enter the Earth's magnetic field ionizes 
                                        up high in the Earth's atmosphere. To the naked eye, the particles 
                                        would appear in the colors green, blue, purple, and more. They 
                                        occur all year round, but the sunlight makes it hard to see them, 
                                        so it's best to view them on a dark night.
                                    </p> 
                                    <p>
                                        The Northern Lights are visible above latitude 60 degrees North, 
                                        and with <strong>Iceland</strong> sitting at latitude 64.9631 
                                        degrees North, it is the perfect place to see them. It can be 
                                        tricky to see them though, so it's best to do your reasearch 
                                        before you book your flight!

                                        I have always had dreams of being royalty. Living the monarchy 
                                        life during the medieval period, during times of knights, and 
                                        warriors, and swords, and prince and princesses. It really gives 
                                        you that fantastical, epic feel. And of course, the dream wouldn't 
                                        be complete without a castle. The Neuschwanstein Castle of 
                                        Bavarian King Ludwig II (1845 - 1886) can be found in <strong>
                                        Bavaria, at Southeastern Germany</strong>. It is a castle 
                                        surrounded by tall trees and wide lakes. If you ask me, Disney 
                                        castles probably took inspiration from this!
