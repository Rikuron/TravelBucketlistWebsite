                        I'm a Filipino who grew up around a place with not many lakes surrounding it. 
                        Then I came across western movies and series with settings on lakes, with the 
                        character going there just to sit and relax. There are even some scenes in which
                        the charaters depicted are a father-child pair, and they would go there to fish 
                        on a Sunday morning. It looked so peaceful and tranquil, like the world is just 
                        the way it should be. Like, just look at the picture on the right, see what I 
                        mean?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I came across Jackson Lake on the internet and I thought to myself, "This is it!
                        If there's a place where I'd want to recreate the feeling I get when I watch 
                        those lake scenes for real, it's gotta be here!". Jackson Lake is one of the 
                        largest high-altitude lakes in the US, sitting at 2,064 meters above sea level. It 
                        is located in <em> Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, USA</em>. Check out some 
                        of the stunning and breath-taking photos taken from the internet below!

                        Ahh yes! Another lake to fulfill my relaxation fishing on a Sunday morning 
                        delusions with. Unlike Jackson Lake however, the greenery around this lake is more 
                        appealing. This feels more suiting for a camping trip, which of course, is something 
                        that I very much like. Just imagine! Creating a natural stove made with the dry wood 
                        around and your scout skills, cooking delicious food in a primitive but relaxing way, 
                        and enjoying that meal with your family as you sit back, relax, and drink in the sight 
                        of the natural wonders the world has provided for us! And as night falls, the stars in 
                        the sky shine as bright as it can be, away from all the light pollution of the city.

                        But anyways, my fantasies aside. The Glacier National Park is an amazing place to 
                        visit. It is located in the Northern Rocky Mountains of <em>Michigan, USA</em>.

                        Oh hey look, another lake posted here by Josh, who would have thought? Seriously
                        though, I just love lakes. The scenery, the waters, the surrounding nature, THE 
                        VIBE! I can't get enough of it! But here it is. What makes the Moraine Lake stand 
                        out from the rest, in my opinion, is that the beauty of its water is unmatched by 
                        any other lakes in North America. It feels so scenic, I'd probably feel bad if I 
                        were allowed to swim in it and I did, because I'd feel like I disturbed the 
                        tranquil environment it had.

                        heard of the Niagara Falls. I myself have, of course, heard of it, but I've never 
                        really thought of checking it out before. And as I was making website, I saw it 
                        as a good opportunity to do so, and boy did I regret not searching about it 
                        earlier. Don't get me wrong, as someone who lives in Iligan City, the City of 
                        Waterfalls of the Philippines, I can attest to the fact that it is deserving of 
                        the title. But Niagara Falls is in another level entirely!

                        The Niagara Falls actually consist of 3 different falls, The Horseshoe Falls, The 
                        American Falls, and The Bridal Veil Falls. Like our very own Maria Cristina Falls 
                        here in Iligan, the Niagara Falls also generate hydroelectric power. It is located 
                        on the border between <em>Ontario, Canada</em> and <em>New York, USA</em>.

                        How can we forget about the place said to be the "Happiest Place on Earth", Walt

                        Disney World really is as magical as they say—whether your idea of magic is 
                        flying through space on a roller coaster or eating your way through 11 countries 
                        in one day. With four theme parks, two water parks, and countless resorts and 
                        restaurants, visitors of every age (little ones, parents, kids at heart) can max 
                        out on good times. Take a nighttime safari at Animal Kingdom, splurge on the chef's 
                        tasting menu at Victoria & Albert's, or catch the Magic Kingdom fireworks from a 
                        boat on the Seven Seas Lagoon. And the fun doesn't have to stop when the day ends. 
                        There's resorts and hotels for every price point, from the luxe Four Seasons Orlando 
                        to countless budget-friendly picks too. (Tripadvisor)
