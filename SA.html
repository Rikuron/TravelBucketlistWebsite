                        I have to admit, unlike North America, I don't know much about South America. From 
                        my impressions of it, though it is certainly an advanced and industrialized place,  
                        it is very much still less industrialized and modernized than its northern counterpart. 
                        Meaning to say, the environment here is more natural and is fresher. That is something I 
                        appreciate. Something I also appreciate are its tourist attractions, so here they are!

                        The Perito Moreno Glacier of Los Glaciares National Park, <em>Argentina</em> is 
                        one of the most striking and unique glaciers in the world. It is said to be that, 
                        unlike most glaciers of the world which are retreating, the Perito Moreno Glacier 
                        is still growing. According to various sources online, one of its highlights is 
                        the Ice Lagoon at its terminus where one can see chunks of ice calving off and 
                        crashing into the water.

                        Yeah when it comes to me and my Travel Bucketlist, there's really no escaping the 
                        lakes or any bodies of water. This is Laguna de Los Tres as well as the 
                        magnificent Mount Fitz Roy right next to it, located in <em>Pantagonia, 
                        Argentina</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Laguna de Los Tres gets its name from the three peaks that surround it: Fitz Roy, 
                        Poincenot, and Saint-Exupéry. It is a beautiful glacial lake found at the base of 
                        Mount Fitz Roy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mount Fitz Roy, also known as Cerro Fitz Roy, on the other hand, is a 3,405 meter 
                        tall mountain. Named after Robert FitzRoy. The combination of the two natural 
                        wonders make this place a must-visit whenever you're in Argentina. When the 
                        skies are clear and the water is undisturbed, it reflects the adjacent mountain 
                        in all of its glory. Check out some of its photos below!

                        A fan of Indiana Jones? Have you always had an interest in ruins exploration or 
                        just archaeology in general? This is the place for you! This is the Ruins of 
                        Machu Picchu, also known as the "Lost City of the Incans", located in the <em>
                        Andres Mountains, Peru</em>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the most notable ruins in the tourist spot are: the Temple of the Sun, 
                        the Intihuatana Stone, the Temple of the Three Windows, the Main Plaza, and the 
                        Royal Tomb. It really goes to show that even though built way back in the 15th 
                        Century, humanity's ancestors were already so smart and well-versed in the ways 
                        of architecture and had a rich culture, contributing to our history.

                        I happen to be an avid player of Genshin Impact, and one region that I really 
                        spent a lot of time playing in, completing as many quests as I can and exploring 
                        the locations to a 100%, is the Sumeru region, specifically, the Desert. And 
                        looking at photos of Huacachina, it makes me wonder if the developers used this 
                        place as inspiration.

                        The Huacachina Sand Dunes is located near the southwestern city of <em>Ica, 
                        Peru</em>. While I'm not much of a hot-climate person, this is still a location 
                        I can enjoy. In the town of Huacachina, there is also vegetation and waterbodies 
                        so there is no need to fear it'll be a hot desert where you'll be thirsty all the 
                        time. In here, you can engage in sandboarding, dune buggy rides, and hiking.
